	This stan script is too compute the WAIC of both models (SSM and Classic approaches). The WAIC computation is the same between the two
	because the growth processus is the same. Only the estimated parameters theta_G differ!

	Note that I ended all the variables related to the ring-width time series by rw (for ring-width)
