#### Aim of prog: Investigate on the measurement error
## Explanations
# Around 950 trees have been measured by two people in Sutton Canada. It was done this way:
#	1. The first person measure many trees (more than a hundred in a row) while the second person takes notes
#	2. Then, the roles are reversed: person 2 measures and person 1 takes notes.
# There should have enough measurements in a row to make sure that the second person is not influenced by the first
